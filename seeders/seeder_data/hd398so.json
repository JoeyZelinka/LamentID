It comes down to the fact that people are *not* equal. Their skill and value to the company will be different. I worked as a lab tech in a dairy plant and we were union. We all got paid the same. I wondered why I was working my ass off compared to some of my coworkers who were universally regarded as lazy. I've since moved to an engineering firm and it's great because what I do actually translates into career progression.","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_submitter":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><blockquote>\n<p>So glad to finally see a bunch of comments pushing back on this nonsense!</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>And yet my comment is controversial. </p>\n\n<blockquote>\n<p>I mostly chalk it up to young people with little real world experience carrying on about how hard the world is.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Yeah.

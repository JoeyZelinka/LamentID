This kinda ended when I finally got my own car. Wasn't a totally bad experience, just more so a meh experience.\n\nRecently got a new EB Mustang since I'm 25 now, clean record.\n\nThere was some ups and downs. I'm super grateful for the sales guy at Ford for allowing me to put a $200 deposit to hold the car without even running my credit for approval. This is important because he easily could've just sold it to someone else since these cars are selling like hot cakes in my area as everywhere I check for new models they're mostly already sold. It had all the specs I wanted in a nice blue color! This dealership was kinda out there so they held the car for almost 2 weeks.\n\nThe buying and financing part was the hassle. They ran my credit and found that while it was good I couldn't get approved since it was my first time taking out this big of a loan. My dad was with me so he offered to co-sign but then they came back and said I would be approved at 84months at 5% APR. I said no and my dad offered again to just co-sign. After that it was just back and forth of me saying no and new offers(my dad use to always say no til  he got what he wanted so I followed). Eventually my dad stepped in and I realized I wasn't like my dad cause man he's aggressive when he negotiates...\n\nWe finally reached a deal where I didn't have to co-sign thanks to father and his experience(he's bought 5 cars already). Got a good monthly plan and 0% APR. I just had to put a bigger down payment than I was expecting. \n\nThe experience left me with a headache and made me realize why some ppl can hate it. Business is business I guess haha. Just wanted to share my newbie experience to give more prospective! Happy you had a good experience. Props for putting family into your vehicle decision! Your sales guy sounds like such an cool dude for doing all that for you!","edited":false,"top_awarded_type":null,"downs":0,"author_flair_css_class":null,"is_submitter":false,"collapsed":false,"author_flair_richtext":[],"author_patreon_flair":false,"body_html":"<div class=\"md\"><p>I&#39;ve never really understood the dealership hate since I&#39;ve always seen it through my dad.

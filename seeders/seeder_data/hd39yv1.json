You’re gonna have to go home.”\n\nHe said it all with a smile. \n\nOh, and then we got a call on the 3 hour drive back home. From my dad. Asking where we were. Because no one has told him he wasn’t going home that day. He was sitting there with his bags packed, wondering why his family was so late. \n\nIt was devastating. Probably a better entry for r/offmychest but this is the first time I’ve been able to type everything out. \n\nAnd yes he’s still there. Thankfully the dog is hanging in there too, but she’s pretty old. We’re currently waiting on news to see if he can get early release/home confinement, but we’ve been waiting for a month so far.

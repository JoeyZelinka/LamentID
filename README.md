<h3>Separate information pages that are also part of the site:</h3>
- The LamentID landing page includes a chart of previously plotted data to show user's before they sign up what the charts may look like. 
- The about page offers general information about the program and how it works. 
- The new project page allows for users to start a new project after they have signed up, and it allows users to add multiple search terms and subreddits for each project.
